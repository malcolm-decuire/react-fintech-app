# FinTech App 
Made w/ React + Material UI with a focus on fintech


## GETTING STARTED 

### REQUIREMENTS

#### Node.js 12+ (versions below could work, but are not tested)

* Linux:

   ```
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

* Windows or macOS:

   https://nodejs.org/en/

### Hands on Keyboard

1. Clone the original repository

   ```
   git clone 
   ```
2. Install dependencies, this can take a minute

   ```
   cd react-saas-template
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local server

   ```
   npm start
   ```

Your browser should now open and show the app. Otherwise open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Editing files will automatically refresh the page.


## what is the local development process 

If you are satisfied with the state of your website you can run:

```
npm run build 
```

It will create a folder named build with your compiled project inside. After that copy its content into your webroot and you are ready to go.
